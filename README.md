Atmospheric Anomaly Detection

A small end-to-end project demonstrating how to:

    Load atmospheric NetCDF data with xarray.
    Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    Compute a simple temperature anomaly measure.
    Detect anomalous observations using Isolation Forest.
    (Optionally) Parallelize operations with Dask.

Project Overview

This project is a simplified demonstration of techniques commonly used in atmospheric science:

    Xarray for managing multi-dimensional atmospheric data in netCDF/HDF.
    Matplotlib for visualization of spatial and temporal data.
    Scikit-learn for anomaly detection with machine learning.
    Dask for parallel or distributed computing on large datasets.

It covers a basic pipeline:

    Load Data: Access a sample or user-provided netCDF file.
    EDA: Plot time-series at a chosen lat/lon point, plus a spatial snapshot.
    Compute Anomaly: Subtract climatological mean from observed temperature to identify “positive” or “negative” anomalies.
    ML-based Anomaly Detection: Use IsolationForest on one or more variables.
    (Optional) Scale with Dask: Demonstrate how to chunk and compute in parallel for large data.

Requirements

    Python 3.7+ (tested on Python 3.10+)
    xarray
    netCDF4
    matplotlib
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    dask (optional, for parallel computing)

Install all with:

pip install xarray netCDF4 matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn dask

Installation

    Clone or download this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/atmos_anomaly_detection.git
cd atmos_anomaly_detection

Install dependencies (if you haven’t already):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    If you don’t have a requirements.txt, see Requirements above.

    Ensure you have a valid netCDF file or plan to use the built-in xarray tutorial data.

Usage
Option A: Run the Tutorial Example

If you just want to run a built-in xarray tutorial dataset without providing your own data:

python atmos_anomaly_detection.py

    The script calls xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature"), which downloads a sample netCDF automatically.
    You’ll see:
        EDA plots of “air” temperature.
        An IsolationForest scatter plot labeling outliers.

Option B: Use Your Own NetCDF File

    Update the code in atmos_anomaly_detection.py to replace the tutorial dataset with your file path. For example:

ds = xr.open_dataset("C:/path/to/your_dataset.nc")

Run the script:

    python atmos_anomaly_detection.py

    Make sure your file path is correct and that your netCDF file exists.

    sample_data/ (optional): You can store a small demo netCDF file here, if you don’t want to rely on the built-in tutorial data.

Customizing for Your Data

    Variable Names
        By default, the script references 'air' (the variable in xarray’s tutorial dataset). If your netCDF file calls temperature something else (e.g., 'temperature', 'temp', etc.), modify the variable names in the script.

    Coordinates
        Make sure your data has dimensions like time, lat, lon if you plan to use the same indexing approach. Otherwise, adapt accordingly.

    Feature Engineering
        The script currently demonstrates a single anomaly measure (air minus mean). You can compute more advanced features: humidity anomalies, wind speed, etc.

    Anomaly Detection
        We use IsolationForest as a simple example, but you can plug in other models like DBSCAN, LOF, or Autoencoder for deeper learning approaches.

    Dask Chunking
        For large files, uncomment the parallel_with_dask() function and experiment with different chunks sizes. This can help with memory constraints and speed.

Known Issues

    FileNotFoundError: Make sure your file path is correct when opening your own netCDF.
    Dependency Conflicts: If you run into library conflicts, install dependencies in a dedicated virtual environment.
